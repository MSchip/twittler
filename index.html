//Creates two global variables, users and streams.
//users is an array of strings -- all the usernames that you're following.
//streams is an object with two properties, users and home.
//streams.home is an array of all tweets from all the users you're following.
//streams.users is an object with properties for each user. streams.users.
//shawndrost has all of shawndrost's tweets.
//Kicks off a periodic process that puts more data in streams.
//You'll mostly be working in the javascript block of index.html. Note: The 
//generated tweets will be displayed in reverse chronological order.
//Basic Requirements:
//Show the user new tweets somehow. (You can show them automatically as they're 
//created, or create a button that displays new tweets.)
//Display the timestamps of when the tweets were created.
//Design your interface so that you want to look at and use the product you're 
//making.
//Allow the user to click on a username to see that user's timeline.
//Extra credit:
//Show when the tweets were created in a human-friendly way (eg "10 minutes ago"). 
//You'll want to find and use a library for this.
//Allow the user to tweet. (This is going to require you to understand a little 
//more about data_generator.js, but you shouldn't need to modify anything.)
